Task Management System

1. Create Task (Add main task)::store this in task table.
Details: Add
T1, -> these are sub-tasks::store each sub-tasks T1, T2 ... in seperate table - task detail table,
with task ID each
T2,
T3 ...
--> First, searched for how to split a string - delimiter and found a function split_string which works
only in SQL (P.S. found this out later after exploring and trying it out for 2-3 days).
Finally, found a Substring_Index function that works in MySQL to seperate the word/sentence using a delimiter.
Tried hands-on, now it works!

--> To implement this in php simply use explode function. https://www.php.net/explode

-->Inner join both task and taskdetail(delimiter seperated table) and insert data into table accordingly.
b. A checkbox beside every sub-task.

c. User option beside every sub-task to select.
